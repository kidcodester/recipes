Ingredients
1 cup flour (any kind)
1/4 cup oats
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 cup milk (dairy or non-dairy)
1 flax egg
2 large ripe bananas
2.5 teaspoons baking powder
1/4 cup dark or semisweet chocolate chips (non-dairy for vegan)
Instructions
To prepare flax egg, combine flaxseed and water in a small bowl, stir and set aside. Peel and mash banana and baking powder together with a fork.
Add in milk, flax egg and stir.
Next add salt, oats and stir. And then add flour and stir until just combined. Add in chocolate chips.
Preheat waffle iron and let batter rest.
Once iron is ready, spray generously with cooking spray (this is key for the batter not to stick) and cook according to instructions.
Remove and set aside and continue to cook rest of the batter.
To serve, I suggest topping with just a few more chocolate chips. But top as you wish - almond butter or maple syrup would also be lovely additions.
Notes
*Be certain to spray cooking spray generously on the waffle iron as these are more apt to stick than a normal batter.
